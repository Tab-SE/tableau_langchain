    For a high level summary ask this way:
    - start with requesting a KPI metrics summary
    - dive deeper on those results using the methods for detailed metric info described below

    For detailed metric info, ask using the target metric plus any of these topics:
    - dimensions
    - data
    - descriptions
    - drivers
    - unusual changes
    - trends
    - sentiment
    - current & previous values
    - period over period change
    - contributors
    - detractors

    NOT for precise data values. Use a data source query tool for specific values.
    NOT for fetching data values on specific dates

    Examples:
    User: give me an update on my KPIs
    Input: 'update on all KPIs, trends, sentiment"

    User: what is going on with sales?
    Input: 'sales trend, data driving sales, unusual changes, contributors, drivers and detractors'

    User: what is the value of sales in 2024?
