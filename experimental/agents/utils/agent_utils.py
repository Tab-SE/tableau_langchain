async def stream_graph_updates(message: dict, graph):
    """
    This function streams responses from Agents to clients, such as chat interfaces, by processing
    user inputs and dynamically updating the conversation.

    The function takes a string input from the user and passes it to the state graph's streaming interface.
    It initiates a stream of events based on the provided user input, which is wrapped in a dictionary with
    a key "messages" containing a tuple of the user role and content.

    As each event is generated by the graph, the function iterates over the values returned. Within each event,
    it specifically looks for messages associated with the 'messages' key. The function extracts and prints the
    content of the last message in the sequence, which is assumed to be the assistant's most recent response.
    This enables a real-time conversation-like interaction where responses are generated and displayed immediately
    based on user input.

    if debugging is enabled (checked via an environment variable), it prints out the content of the last message
    for further inspection.

    Parameters:
    - message (dict): contains a string with the user_message and additional operating parameters
    - graph: a representation of the agents behavior and tool set

    Returns:
    - None. The function's primary side effect is to print the assistant's response to the console.
